    <p>
      Thank you for your interest in volunteering with us! You can volunteer to help us with a
      specific project, event, going to the homeless shelters with us or helping us out around the
      office. Whatever it is, you are guaranteed to leave with a full heart and ear to ear smile!
    </p>
    <p>
      While we greatly need and appreciate all of the volunteer assistance we receive, we do not
      have a full time volunteer manager on staff. Thank you in advance for understanding that your
      application may take a few weeks to get processed.
