# Volunteer and Event Management Platform

Refactor list:

- route to correct eventmanager based on auth level
- figure out a way to make helpers consistent
- see if anything bled through when converting App.jsx to \_app.jsx
  - make \_app.jsx handle less logic.
- break up actions/queries.js into multple files
- readd validation back into server actions using next-connect and express-validator
- I think splash is a weird component to have, just have all of that logic be handled inside of the index page or promote splash to its own screens folder.
- put auth back into this application, the files and api routes exist but nothing is filled in properly.
- settings is wrong

migration list:

- make the api best practices because it seems pretty all over the place
  - add some type of api documentation/swagger or whatever
- use ssr in place of useeffect (use isomorphic unfetch in this case)
- follow the lint conventions
  - there are no prop types for anything

## Stack

- React.js: Front-end
- Next.js: API routes and server-side rendering
- MongoDB: Permanently storing info
- eslint: Automatically identifying and fixing code errors
- prettier: Setting a common code style and fixing any issues. If you would like to adjust any prettier settings like quote style or include semicolons, look in `.prettierrc`
- yarn: Package management. If you do not have yarn, run `npm install -g yarn` to install yarn globally.

## Setup

### Initializing Env Vars

- If you are an EM setting up a project for the first time, read [the Bitwarden guide here](https://gtbitsofgood.notion.site/Secrets-Passwords-Bitwarden-74c4806a1f29485b8fb85ea29f273ab9) before continuing forward.
- Run `yarn secrets` to sync development secrets from Bitwarden and save them to a local `.env` file. Contact a leadership member for the Bitwarden password.
  - **Note**: If you are using Windows, enter `yarn secrets:login` and then `yarn secrets:sync` instead of the above script.

### Updating Env Vars

- For dev, update `.env` and `next.config.js`
- For production, add the env vars to your host, **NEVER** commit `.env` to your version control system.

### MongoDB

A running instance of MongoDB is required this project.

- Decide if you want to run MongoDB locally or remotely
- Locally (Docker (RECOMMENDED))
  1. [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
  2. Run `docker run --name mongodb -d -p 27017:27017 mongo` in your terminal
  3. Open Docker Desktop and confirm that your MongoDB image is running. It should exist on port 27017, and can be accessed.
- Locally (Non-Docker)
  1. [Download MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)
  2. Go through the installation instructions.
     - Leave the port at default 27017
- Remotely
  1. Create a MongoDB instance on MongoDB Atlas
  2. In Security → Network Access: add the IP address `0.0.0.0/0` (all IPs)
  3. In Security → Database Access: Add new database user
  4. In Data Storage → Clusters: Find your cluster and click `Connect` → `Connect your application` and copy the connection string, set the username and password, and set this as `MONGO_DB` in `.env`
- Create the `nextjs` database. (or choose another name, but make sure to change it in `.env`)
- It's very helpful to install MongoDB Compass to see your database contents

### Node

1. Clone this project to your computer
2. Navigate to this project in terminal and enter `yarn`
3. Rename `example.env` to `.env` and fill it out with the dev config

### Development with Docker

To run the development environment using Docker:

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and build the Docker image (if needed, though typically not required for development as Docker Compose will handle it):
docker build -t helping-mama .

3. Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to start the containers:
docker-compose up

## Running

### Development

To understand this code better, read the [Code Tour](/CODETOUR.md).

1. Run `yarn`
2. Run `yarn dev`

### Production

1. Setup your host/vm and the necessary env vars
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `yarn start`

## Other Info

Adding a success pop-up to any new actions

1. Add imports\
   `import { useContext } from "react";`\
   `import { RequestContext } from "../../../providers/RequestProvider";` (adjust path accordingly)
2. Define the context\
   `const context = useContext(RequestContext);`
3. Create a context success instance and display your message\
    `context.startLoading();`\
    `context.success("<Insert Success Message Here>");`\
   NOTE: If doing this in a class component, define context as a prop and send this information in where you call the class. See [Profile](https://github.com/GTBitsOfGood/helping-mamas/blob/dev/src/screens/Profile/Profile.jsx) and [ProfileForm](https://github.com/GTBitsOfGood/helping-mamas/blob/dev/src/screens/Profile/ProfileTable.jsx) for examples.

### Styling

- By default, this repository uses Next `^9.2.0` for styles, which includes native support for global CSS and CSS modules
- However, this version only allows global css to be in `pages/_app.js`, which can cause issues with external packages
- If you face this error, the solution is installing [`@zeit/next-css` and adding it to `next.config.js`](https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-css), however you cannot use css modules and global css together with this package (and it defaults to global).
